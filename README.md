# Ways to contribute
Help to build the icecube lab. Currently we have a green building with a couple of white tubes on the side. The real building is much more interesting and fun to build, explore and study in. The lab is built using https://threejs.org commands and can accept objects built with https://www.blender.org/ (free and open source software). The lab file name to edit is "buildlab.js", in the "src" folder.

# How to move around
Use the mouse buttons to look around (hold the left button down) or to move around (hold the right button down). You can zoom in with the center wheel. Also, the arrow keys (left/right/up/down) move you around very nicely. On touch screens, one finger to look around, two fingers to move or zoom.
