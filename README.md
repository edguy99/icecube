# Icecube - Catching neutrinos at the south pole
To run:

# How to move around
Use the mouse buttons to look around (hold the left button down) or to move around (hold the right button down). You can zoom in with the center wheel. Also, the arrow keys (left/right/up/down) move you around very nicely. On touch screens, one finger to look around, two fingers to move or zoom.

# Ways to contribute
Help to build the icecube lab. Currently we have a green building with a couple of white tubes on the side. The real building is much more interesting and fun to build, explore and study in. The lab is built using https://threejs.org commands and can accept objects built with https://www.blender.org/ (free and open source software). The lab file name to edit is "buildlab.js", in the "src" folder.

# Projects under consideration
1. Expand 3d viewing to new devices (Meta Quest...). Currently VR headsets supported, tilt left - up/down, tilt right - forward/back, look left/right/up/down. Select "ENABLE VR HEADSET" from this link: https://raw.githack.com/edguy99/icecube/main/icecube.htm?vr=true
2. Expansion of the data-base access beyond the Kaggle2023 project to real data. Using or developing some sort of api to allow access to existing, and/or new data brought back from the South Pole. Feasibility and time-frame unknown.
3. Refined routines for Santa and MSanta style analysis to both improve predictability and confirm/review other models that are predicting direction. Unknown interest in this method given advances in things like Graph Neural Networks or other AI algorithms. But perhaps some are interested.
4. Add in newer Graph Neural Networks or other AI algorithms that can be developed/tested against real data. Addition tools for analysis, gives researchers more ideas and adds to the value of existing storehouse of Icecube data.
