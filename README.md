# Ways to contribute
Help to build the icecube lab. Currently we have a green building with a couple of white tubes on the side. The real building is much more interesting and fun to build, explore and study in. The lab is built using https://threejs.org commands and can accept objects built with https://www.blender.org/ (free user supported software). The lab file name to edit is "buildlab.js", in the "src" folder.
